Low-Cost-Logic-Analyser
=======================

To use the Tiva C series Launchpad (low cost ARM Cortex M4F microconroller board) as a hardware platform for a logic analyser that will upload captured data to a PC for display. The PC will display captured data using a Python program. It will also direct the operation of the Launchpad board (controlling sample rate, trigger etc).
